		Bubble Tea is a drink made with our original blend of tea and natural flavors served over sweet and chewy pearls. These pearls also known as "bobas" and are made from tapioca starch and taste faintly like caramel-flavored Jell-O. We give you a big and fat straw so that you can enjoy your drink and chew your pearls. A healthier version of a smoothie; bubble tea is low in sugar and calories!
